Site Primer

Walks a website and prints out all urls and the time to retrieve the page.

Usage:
The program just takes one argument, the site to crawl/test.

SitePrimer.exe [site to test]

Notes:
The crawler will run the site through a regex that replaces all numbers with a generic
id tag so each page with variations on a number are not crawled.  The point of the
crawler is to hit each page that runs unique code.
